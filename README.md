Lab 1a – Java Practice
OBJECTIVES
 Familiarise yourself with the NetBeans environment
 Practice some java programming skills
 Develop a Random Number Generator with Random ()
 Develop a Random Student Name Generator using an ArrayList
Code Editing Tasks
▪ Task 1: Create an Instance of the Random Class using the Random () method
▪ Task 2: Print out a random number between 0 and 18
Test the code to validate a random number is generated
▪ Task 3: Copy out the First Name or Full Name of fellow students in your Cohort (e.g HDCSDEV_INTJAN21) and arrange in an alphabetical order.
▪ Task 4: Add the names as elements to an ArrayList called names
▪ Task 5: Print out a random student’s name in the format below:
The student you have randomly picked is: Abraham Lincoln
Student Name

Lab 1b – Java Practice
OBJECTIVES
 Familiarise yourself with the NetBeans environment
 Practice some java programming skills
Code Editing Tasks
▪ Task 1: Create and add three Person Names to an ArrayList. Each element will be added at the end of the list
▪ Task 2: Print the elements of the ArrayList using the following approaches
o toString() method
o A For loop combined with get() method
Assess the differences in printing when using the two approaches
▪ Task 3: Add a new Person’s name on the second position of the ArrayList
▪ Task 4: Print the elements of the ArrayList using ITERATOR object to check if the new person was added
▪ Task 5: Remove the element(person) on first position
▪ Task 6: Print the elements of the ArrayList to check if the person was removed
▪ Task 7: Check if a person with a given name exists in the ArrayList . If so, print person’s position in the list.

Lab 1c – Java Practice
OBJECTIVES
 Familiarise yourself with the NetBeans environment
 Practice some java programming skills
 Develop ArrayList Example project (in NetBeans) to practice some operations performed on an ArrayList object
 Work through the tasks in the main class
Code Editing Tasks
▪ Task 1: Create and add three Person type objects to the ArrayList object. Each element will be added at the end of the list
▪ Task 2: Print the elements of the ArrayList using the following approaches
o toString() method
o A For loop combined with printPerson() method part of the Person class.
Note: printPerson() prints info regarding ONE person
Assess the differences in printing when using the two approaches
▪ Task 3: Add a Person object (a new person) on the second position of the ArrayList
▪ Task 4: Print the elements of the ArrayList using ITERATOR object to check if the new person was added
▪ Task 5: Remove the element(person) on first position
▪ Task 6: Print the elements of the ArrayList to check if the person was removed
▪ Task 7: Check if a person with a given name exists in the ArrayList . If so, print person’s position in the list.
